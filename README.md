## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Advanced Turf Search:** Users can search for turfs by location and apply multiple filters for price, turf type (indoor/outdoor), and amenities.
*   **Real-Time Availability:** A dynamic calendar on each turf's detail page shows available and booked slots in real-time, preventing booking conflicts.
*   **Secure Payments:** End-to-end payment integration using **Razorpay**, with backend order creation and cryptographic signature verification for transaction integrity.
*   **Secure User Authentication:** Role-based user and admin access using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**, with password hashing via **bcrypt**.
*   **Atomic Bookings:** The backend is engineered to prevent race conditions and double-bookings, ensuring that a slot can only be booked once, even with simultaneous requests.
*   **Admin Dashboard (Future Scope):** A dedicated interface for turf owners to manage their turf details, view bookings, and analyze revenue.
*   **User Profiles (Future Scope):** A section for users to view their past and upcoming bookings.
